or, in a decent English translation, "The end of a matter is better than its beginning; likewise, patience is better than pride." [^1] 

This is the beginning of my venture into website building. I'm stumbling a lot at the moment, but the folks at [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) have made it a whole lot easier than trying to sit here and type a bunch of html. Thanks! Oh, and while I'm thanking people, I'm immensely grateful to [Jonathan McGlone](jmcglone.com) for putting together the [website-building guide I followed](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)! Also to Julian Thilo for putting together the [guide to running Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)!

So now comes the part with the patience--slowly learning to use my tools, and to create something good and worthwhile here.





[^1]: That's Ecclesiastes 7:8 NIV, in case you're interested. Unless you're using the Vulgate, quoted in the title, in which case for some reason it's Ecclesiastes 7:9. Also, yes, I only quoted the first half in the title. Give a guy a break, huh?
