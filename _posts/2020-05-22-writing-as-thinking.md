# Writing as Thinking

One of the key ideas that has stuck with me from my course in ethnographic methods is the idea that writing is a form of thinking. In working on typing my "About Me" page, I've run into that issue once again. In attempting to present myself to the world more generally, and (let's be honest here) future hiring committees and people interested in my work more specifically, I've found it easy to go off on tangents, and need to come back and edit and rein myself in, thinking more about the agendas of those reading my work than the points I'm interested in making.
