		<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

		<p>"To teach is to create a space in which the community of truth is practiced," and this captures the soul of my teaching. I want students to cultivate transferable skills: the ability to read critically, think sociologically, engage in dialogue across difference, and connect research to real-world challenges.</p>

		<h3>Creating Space</h3>

		<p>My pedagogy grows out of active and experiential learning, built around the cycle of encounter and reflection. Students engage with material before class, then participate in small-group dialogue and collaborative activities that help them process and apply concepts. These give quieter students room to participate in ways they might not in larger group discussions.</p>

		<h3>Nurturing Communities of Truth</h3>

		<p>I center methods that build teamwork and empathy, even in challenging material. Students practice sociological sympathyâ€”seeing the world through perspectives that may initially feel uncomfortable, but that expand their capacity for understanding.</p>

		<h3>Supporting Practice</h3>

		<p>Behind the ideals are structures that help students grow. I align assignments with transferable skills and design portfolio projects that connect to students' goals and interests. The results have been breathtaking: documentaries, podcasts, policy briefs, and creative projects that demonstrate deep engagement with course material.</p>
