## Teaching

### As Instructor:

`Fall 2025 + 2x prior`
**Movements for Social Justice**
- I designed and taught this course, in which students used several different theoretical lenses to study contemporary social movements including Black Lives Matter, Me Too, and the anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protests, as well as earlier twentieth-century movements. I used a central wiki-building activity to tie the course together.

`Fall 2025 + 3x prior`
**Social Theory**
- I redesigned Bryn Mawr's core Social Theory course to better reflect the diversity of topics and theorists taken up as conversation partners in contemporary sociology. The new version of the course begins with a module on theorizing as a component of the research process. During this module, students construct a theoretical explanation of a puzzling social phenomenon of their choosing from available observation. The latter part of the course proceeds thematically, with each semester's themes chosen based on students' projects. Each class session traces a single sociological theme, reading extracts from the sociological canon alongside more recent work developing and challenging early formulations. 

`Spring 2025 + 1x prior` 
**Social Dynamics of Violence**
- I designed this elective course as a survey of work in the sociology of violence, ranging from topics typically covered in Criminology courses (murder, domestic violence, school shootings, drug market violence) to those typically covered in courses on Social Movements (riots, pogroms, and genocides) and those typically covered in Military Sociology (battle dynamics, military organization, and guerrilla warfare) or Political Sociology (state formation, revolution, and imperial collapse). The course offers an opportunity to compare features of violence that recur across scales of social action. A portfolio project allows students to explore particular forms of violence or cross-cutting themes in greater depth.

`Fall 2025 + 2x prior`
**Punishment and Social Order**  
- I redesigned this elective course as an ethnographic introduction to the US Criminal Legal System. Over the course of the semester, students read four ethnographies, one each related to policing, incarceration, criminal courts, and re-entry. These are supplemented with additional readings, mostly qualitative. Pride of place is given to the perspective of those punished, but students also read work that explores the social worlds of police, prison guards, lawyers, judges, family members, and those working to facilitate re-entry. Students are introduced to Restorative and Transformative Justice alternatives, as well as to traditional systems of restitution and experiments in criminal legal reform elsewhere in the world. Students produce policy briefs arguing, with evidence, for particular policies or pathways toward criminal justice reform. 

`Spring 2025 + 1x prior`
**The Social Life of Emotions**
- I designed and taught this course to introduce students to the contemporary sociology of emotions. Readings and discussions reintroduce students to emotions as culturally varied, yet more universally comprehensible than most linguistic codes, as products of situational structure and social norms, and as objects of agentic work and social exchange. A portfolio project allows students to explore particular emotions or social patterns of emotional experience in greater depth.

`Fall 2023`
**From Conversation to Society: Microsociological Perspectives**
- I designed and taught this course as a survey of several key theoretical approaches to micro-sociology, including symbolic interaction, dramaturgy, ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the phenomenology of the body. Later parts of the semester traced ways in which these microsociological approaches have enriched the study of meso-scale (networks, groups, organizations) and macro-scale (race, class, gender) sociological phenomena.

`Fall 2023`
**Global Sociology: Capital, Power, and Protest in World-Historical Perspective**
- I co-designed this seminar with students, exploring several key approaches to the study of global social phenomena, including world systems theory, transnational sociology, world ecology, and postcolonial studies of empire. The latter parts of the course provided opportunities to explore global scale social phenomena chosen by students, including global commodity chains, global patterns of inequality, media and tourist flows, NGO and missionary networks, transnational social movements, and the current wave of anti-global nationalism. Students produced portfolio projects that explored the multiplexity of political, economic, cultural, and ecological ties between two cities or other geographical locations.

`Fall 2024`
**Varieties of Sociological Imagination: Voices from the Majority World**
- I designed and taught this seminar to introduce students to a variety of social theories or forms of social analysis from various regions of the world--men and women from African, South American, Middle Eastern, South, Southeast, and East Asian cultural basins--whose work reflected critically or analytically on their own social worlds. Students read work exploring Southern, autonomous, indigenous, and connected modes of sociological theorizing as alternatives to Euro- and Anglocentric approaches to sociology.

`Upcoming`
**Social Problems/Community Conversations** (Working Title)
- I am currently designing this course as an experimental seminar, to be held at a public library in an underserved neighborhood near Bryn Mawr. The intention is for current Bryn Mawr students to compose about half of the class, with the other half of the course composed of interested community members. The course will be co-constructed with students, exploring social problems of interest to those taking the course from a sociological perspective.

### As Teaching Assistant:

`Spring 2018`
**Intro to Sociology** (Penn)
- I led discussions and used backward-design principles to create activities for two discussion- and activity-based recitation sessions of 20 students each.

`Spring 2015 + 2x prior`
**Intro to Social Research** (Penn)
- In six recitations spread over three semesters, I helped over 110 students design and develop their own research projects. In addition, I led discussion sessions and designed and led in-class activities supporting the main lectures.

`Spring 2019` 
**Global and Regional Analysis** (Lauder Institute, Penn)
- Graded student papers, designed exams, and hosted guest lecturers for Europe section. 

`Fall 2016` 
**Medical Sociology** (Penn)
- Graded student papers

`Spring 2010` 
**Introduction to Linguistics** (Rice)
  - Graded student papers
