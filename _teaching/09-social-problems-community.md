**Course Type:** Experimental seminar  
**Institution:** Bryn Mawr College  
**Semester:** Spring 2026 (Upcoming)  
**Location:** Public library in underserved neighborhood near Bryn Mawr  
**Enrollment:** Mixed college students and community members

## Course Description

I am currently designing this course as an experimental seminar, to be held at a public library in an underserved neighborhood near Bryn Mawr. The intention is for current Bryn Mawr students to compose about half of the class, with the other half of the course composed of interested community members. The course will be co-constructed with students, exploring social problems of interest to those taking the course from a sociological perspective.

## Innovative Features

- **Community-based location:** Held in public library rather than on campus
- **Mixed enrollment:** College students and community members learning together
- **Co-constructed curriculum:** Course content shaped by participant interests and concerns
- **Public sociology:** Bringing academic analysis into community conversation
- **Accessibility focus:** Designed to be welcoming and accessible to diverse participants

## Pedagogical Approach

- **Community organizing principles:** Democratic participation and shared leadership
- **Portfolio projects:** Collaborative investigations of local social issues
- **Dialogue across difference:** Structured conversations across educational and economic backgrounds
- **Applied sociology:** Connecting theoretical frameworks to lived experience
- **Asset-based community development:** Building on community strengths and knowledge

## Key Learning Goals

- Understanding social problems as complex, systemic phenomena
- Development of sociological perspective on local issues
- Practice in democratic dialogue and collaborative inquiry
- Connection between academic knowledge and community wisdom
- Skills in public engagement and civic participation

## Course Structure

The specific topics and structure will be determined collaboratively with participants, focusing on social problems identified as priorities by both students and community members.
