**Course Type:** Upper-level elective  
**Institution:** Bryn Mawr College  
**Semesters Taught:** Fall 2025 + 2x prior  
**Enrollment:** 15-20 students

## Course Description

I designed and taught this course, in which students used several different theoretical lenses to study contemporary social movements including Black Lives Matter, Me Too, and the anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protests, as well as earlier twentieth-century movements. I used a central wiki-building activity to tie the course together.

## Pedagogical Approach

- **Multiple theoretical lenses:** Students apply different frameworks to understand movement dynamics
- **Collaborative wiki-building:** Class-wide project that synthesizes learning across the semester  
- **Contemporary focus:** Emphasis on current movements with historical context
- **Student-driven inquiry:** Students help shape topics and research questions
- **Community building:** Creating spaces for dialogue across difference

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding social movements as complex, multi-faceted phenomena
- Application of multiple theoretical frameworks to movement analysis
- Recognition of movement strategies, tactics, and organizational forms
- Analysis of how movements adapt to changing political contexts
- Development of collaborative research and presentation skills

## Course Structure

Students examine movements through various analytical lenses while contributing to a collaborative wiki that becomes a comprehensive resource on social movement theory and practice.

## Student Impact

The wiki-building activity helps students see connections between different movements and theoretical approaches while developing digital collaboration skills valuable beyond the classroom.
