**Course Type:** Upper-level seminar  
**Institution:** Bryn Mawr College  
**Semester Taught:** Fall 2024  
**Enrollment:** 15-20 students

## Course Description

I designed and taught this seminar to introduce students to a variety of social theories or forms of social analysis from various regions of the world--men and women from African, South American, Middle Eastern, South, Southeast, and East Asian cultural basins--whose work reflected critically or analytically on their own social worlds. Students read work exploring Southern, autonomous, indigenous, and connected modes of sociological theorizing as alternatives to Euro- and Anglocentric approaches to sociology.

## Pedagogical Approach

- **Decolonizing curriculum:** Centering voices and perspectives from the Global South
- **Portfolio projects:** Students explore non-Western theoretical frameworks in depth
- **Critical reflection:** Examining assumptions embedded in mainstream sociological theory
- **Comparative analysis:** Understanding how context shapes theoretical development
- **Community of truth:** Building inclusive learning environments across difference

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding sociology as a global, diverse discipline
- Recognition of how geographic and cultural location shapes theoretical perspectives
- Critical analysis of Euro-centric assumptions in mainstream sociology
- Application of non-Western theoretical frameworks to contemporary issues
- Development of more inclusive and globally-aware sociological imagination

## Course Themes

- **Southern Theory:** Theoretical frameworks developed in the Global South
- **Indigenous Sociology:** Traditional knowledge systems and social analysis
- **Postcolonial Perspectives:** Understanding the ongoing effects of colonialism
- **Connected Sociologies:** Relationships between different theoretical traditions

## Assessment

The course uses reflective assessment methods that encourage students to examine their own theoretical assumptions while engaging seriously with diverse intellectual traditions.
