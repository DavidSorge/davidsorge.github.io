	<h1>More about my life</h1>
	<p>I'm a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, studying social movements, micro-sociology, and the escalation, propogation, and de-escalation dynamics of conflict. I want to understand how people find themselves in conflict, and how different parties attempts to handle that conflict lead to more conflict, toward a return to old rhythms of life, or toward the making of new patterns of relationship</p>
	<p>Most of my work focuses on studying how the political process works in South Asia broadly, and India specifically. India is sociologically. Its diversity, political history, economic growth, arts, culture, vigorous civic life--each are worth study on their own merits. As historian Ramachandra Guha has said:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/ramachandra-guha/india-after-gandhi/9781447281887">
		<p> As a laboratory of social conflict the India of the twentieth century is – for the historian – at least as interesting as the Europe of the nineteenth. . . . At no other time or place in human history have social conflicts been so richly diverse, so vigorously articulated, so eloquently manifest in art and literature, or addressed with such directness by the political system and the media.</p>

    <p>While South Asian society is worth studying on its own merits, my interest in studying it also has biographical roots. Between age 2 and age 18, I lived in South Asia, first in the Maldives, then in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. I later did field work in Gujarat and Delhi, and studied Hindi and Urdu in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
