**Abstract:** This single-case analysis examines the micro-dynamics of successful de-escalation in potential collective violence. Using detailed ethnographic analysis, I trace how emotional energy is redirected during critical moments to prevent escalation.

**Methods:** Single-case analysis, ethnographic observation, micro-sociological analysis

**Key Findings:**
- Emotional work by key actors can successfully redirect collective energy
- De-escalation requires specific interaction sequences and timing
- Individual agency operates within structural constraints

**Implications:** Provides practical insights for violence prevention while advancing theoretical understanding of how emotions operate in collective action contexts.
