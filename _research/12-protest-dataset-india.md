**Status:** Current Project

**Abstract:** This project involves building a comprehensive protest event dataset for India, systematically coding news reports to create a reliable database of collective action events. The dataset will enable large-scale quantitative analysis of protest patterns and outcomes.

**Methods:** Automated text processing, human coding, data validation, database development

**Scope:** Multi-decade coverage of protest events across India

**Key Features:**
- Standardized event coding protocols
- Geographic and temporal coverage
- Multiple event types and outcomes
- Linkage to contextual data

**Applications:** Will enable research on protest cycles, diffusion patterns, and the relationship between collective action and political change.
