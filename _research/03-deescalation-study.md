**Abstract:** This paper examines how a school clerk successfully de-escalated a potentially deadly confrontation with an armed gunman. Using interaction ritual theory, I demonstrate how internalized rituals can shift emotional trajectories and interrupt violence in critical moments.

**Methods:** Ethnographic analysis, interaction ritual theory, case study methodology

**Key Findings:**
- Successful de-escalation involves specific interaction ritual chains
- Emotional energy can be redirected from violence to connection
- Training in interaction rituals has implications for violence prevention

**Broader Impact:** This research contributes to understanding how violence can be interrupted at the micro-level, informing approaches to crisis intervention and community safety that don't rely on militarized policing.
