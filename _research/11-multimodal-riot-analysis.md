**Status:** Current Project (DANGA Lab)

**Funding:** High-performance computing resources, student researcher support

**Abstract:** This flagship project of the DANGA Lab integrates multiple data modalities—newspapers, photos, video recordings—to understand escalation and de-escalation dynamics in collective violence events. The project combines computational analysis with detailed qualitative case studies.

**Methods:** Multi-modal data analysis, computational text analysis, video ethnography, machine learning

**Data Sources:**
- Newspaper reports of riot-like events
- Photographic documentation
- Video recordings of collective violence

**Team:** Student researchers, high-performance computing collaboration

**Implications:** Developing new methodological approaches for understanding complex social phenomena while advancing theoretical knowledge of violence dynamics.
