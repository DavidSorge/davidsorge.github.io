**Status:** Current Project

**Abstract:** This methodological project examines how deviant cases—instances where collective violence fails to follow expected patterns—can serve as powerful tools for theoretical development. I analyze cases where expected violence did not occur or took unexpected forms.

**Methods:** Deviant case analysis, comparative case studies, theoretical development

**Key Contributions:**
- Advances methodology for using deviant cases
- Identifies scope conditions for existing theories
- Develops new theoretical propositions

**Theoretical Focus:**
- When do expected violence patterns fail to emerge?
- What can successful de-escalation teach us about escalation?
- How do structural conditions interact with contingent events?

**Implications:** Provides methodological innovations for violence research while advancing theoretical understanding through systematic analysis of exceptional cases.
