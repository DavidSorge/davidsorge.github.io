**Status:** Under Review at *Journal of Peace Research*

**Abstract:** This paper uses event-history analysis to demonstrate how riots diffuse through vernacular-language media networks, supporting arguments that state-level communication infrastructures drive patterns of unrest across India.

**Methods:** Event-history analysis, GIS mapping, network analysis, computational text analysis

**Key Findings:**
- Riot diffusion follows vernacular media network structures
- Language boundaries create distinct diffusion patterns
- State-level media infrastructure shapes violence geography

**Theoretical Contributions:** Brings media and communication back into the study of collective violence, showing how information flows shape the spatial and temporal patterns of unrest.

**Policy Implications:** Understanding media-driven diffusion patterns can inform early warning systems and intervention strategies.
