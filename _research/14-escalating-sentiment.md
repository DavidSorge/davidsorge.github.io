**Status:** Current Project

**Abstract:** This project uses computational sentiment analysis and social network analysis to examine how community sentiment and polarization escalate in the lead-up to collective violence. I analyze online discourse, media coverage, and community interactions to identify early warning signals.

**Methods:** Computational sentiment analysis, social network analysis, time series analysis, machine learning

**Data Sources:**
- Social media discourse
- Local news coverage
- Community interaction patterns
- Historical violence event data

**Key Questions:**
- How does sentiment polarization precede violence?
- What role do social networks play in escalation?
- Can computational methods identify early warning signals?

**Implications:** Develops early warning capabilities for violence prevention while advancing understanding of how digital communication shapes offline collective action.
