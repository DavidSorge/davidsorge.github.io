**Status:** Under Review at *American Journal of Sociology*

**Abstract:** This paper uses computational text analysis of *Times of India* riot reports to demonstrate that the repertoire of collective violence has been remarkably stable across several decades. Building on theories of repertoires and emotional energy, I identify recurrent "scenes" such as slogan-shouting and standoffs, showing how they generate or drain collective emotional energy.

**Methods:** Computational text analysis, historical analysis, ethnographic video analysis

**Key Findings:**
- Riot repertoires show remarkable stability over time
- Specific interaction sequences predict escalation vs. de-escalation
- Media representations shape repertoire diffusion

**Implications:** Advances theoretical understanding of how violent repertoires are maintained and transmitted, with applications for violence prevention and community protection strategies.
