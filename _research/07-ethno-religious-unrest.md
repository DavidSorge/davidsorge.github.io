**Abstract:** This paper investigates whether contemporary ethno-religious unrest in India represents emergent social phenomena or the performance of established cultural repertoires. Through computational analysis of news reports and ethnographic case studies, I examine the patterned nature of communal violence.

**Methods:** Computational text analysis, historical comparison, ethnographic case studies

**Key Findings:**
- Unrest follows predictable repertoires rather than emerging spontaneously
- Performance scripts are transmitted across time and space
- Media coverage shapes repertoire evolution

**Implications:** Challenges assumptions about spontaneous violence and demonstrates the importance of cultural repertoires in understanding collective violence patterns.
