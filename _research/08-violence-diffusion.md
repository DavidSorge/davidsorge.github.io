**Abstract:** This paper examines the diffusion of collective violence across India using large-scale analysis of riot events. I test competing theories of violence diffusion, examining both geographic proximity and social network mechanisms.

**Methods:** Event history analysis, diffusion modeling, spatial analysis, large-scale news corpus analysis

**Data:** 7.3M *Times of India* articles (1950â€“2000)

**Key Findings:**
- Violence spreads through predictable diffusion mechanisms
- Geographic proximity and social networks both matter
- Media coverage accelerates diffusion processes

**Implications:** Advances theoretical understanding of violence diffusion with practical applications for early warning systems and violence prevention strategies.
