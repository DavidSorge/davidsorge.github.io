**Status:** In Preparation

**Abstract:** This paper examines the role of elite actors in mobilizing and directing collective violence through moral frameworks. I analyze how political and religious elites use moral rhetoric to legitimate violence and shape its targets and boundaries.

**Methods:** Elite network analysis, discourse analysis, historical case studies

**Key Contributions:**
- Theorizes the role of moral entrepreneurs in violence
- Demonstrates elite strategic use of moral frameworks
- Links micro-level violence to macro-level political processes

**Implications:** Advances understanding of how violence is politically organized and morally justified, with applications for conflict prevention and post-conflict reconciliation.
