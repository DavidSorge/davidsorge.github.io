**Status:** In Preparation

**Abstract:** This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding riots as interaction ritual webs, drawing on Durkheim's concept of collective effervescence and Collins' interaction ritual theory. I analyze how violent encounters generate emotional energy that sustains and spreads collective action.

**Methods:** Theoretical development, ethnographic analysis, video analysis of riot events

**Key Contributions:**
- Extends interaction ritual theory to violent collective action
- Explains how emotional energy sustains violence over time
- Provides framework for understanding violence as social ritual

**Implications:** Offers new theoretical tools for understanding the emotional and ritual dimensions of collective violence, with applications for violence prevention and community healing.
