# Sociology is a group project

I believe in the necessity and power of collaboration. I'd love to work on a project with you, if we can find an area of mutual interest.

## Areas of Interest

* Conflict escalation and de-escalation
* Social movement ecology and diffusion
* Computational text analysis
* Multimodal event analysis
* Restorative and transformative justice

## Contact

Feel free to reach out at [dsorge@brynmawr.edu](mailto:dsorge@brynmawr.edu) if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations.
