<p>This is the beginning of my venture into website building. I’m stumbling a lot at the moment, but the folks at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> have made it a whole lot easier than trying to sit here and type a bunch of html. Thanks! Oh, and while I’m thanking people, I’m immensely grateful to <a href="jmcglone.com">Jonathan McGlone</a> for putting together the <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">website-building guide I followed</a>! Also to Julian Thilo for putting together the <a href="https://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">guide to running Jekyll on Windows</a>!</p>

<p>So now comes the part with the patience–slowly learning to use my tools, and to create something good and worthwhile here.</p>
